* yamm

yamm is a yaml preprocessing language I made to practice making DSL's.

** Proposal
   
#+BEGIN_SRC
--- # The yamms are the powers that be
  processed: $e (equal? 5 5.0) e$
  $e (for/hash ([i (in-range 5)]
               [j '("bunch" "of" "values" "here")])
      (values i j) e$

$e (list "this" "is" "a" "list") e$
#+END_SRC

Will give:

#+BEGIN_SRC 
--- # The yamms are the powers that be
  processed: Yes
  1: bunch
  2: of
  3: values
  4: here

- this
- is
- a
- list
#+END_SRC

It kinda works, but has a lot of usability and sanity issues that I do not want to really fix at the moment. YAML is quite messy to deal with.

If you need something like this, have a look at [[https://dhall-lang.org/][Dhall]].
