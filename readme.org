* yamm

yamm is a yaml preprocessing language that allows you to embed lisp expressions into your yaml.

** Proposal
   
#+BEGIN_SRC
--- # The yamms are the powers that be
  processed: $ (equal? 5 5.0) $
  $ (for/hash ([i (in-range 5)]
               [j '("bunch" "of" "values" "here")])
      (values i j) $
#+END_SRC

Will give:

#+BEGIN_SRC 
--- # The yamms are the powers that be
  processed: Yes
  1: bunch
  2: of
  3: values
  4: here
#+END_SRC
